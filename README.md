Temple of Rogue
==========

![](images/screenshot.jpg)

Attempting to make a roguelike with some features inspired by my previous game Temple of ROM.

Work in progress.  Not anywhere near playable yet.

**Todo**

- Draw player and scroll him around
- Number displaying routines to put values into the status areas
- Reduce complexity of the maze to make it look less crowded and prettier
