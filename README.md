Temple of Rogue
==========

![](images/screenshot.jpg)

Attempting to make a roguelike with some features inspired by my previous game Temple of ROM.

Work in progress.  Not anywhere near playable yet.

**Update**

I'm still not yet drawing the player and scrolling him around; that'll keep me busy for a few days.

Once I finish that, I've got to figure out what kind of game I want to make out of this; so far it's just figuring out the mechanics of generating/drawing a scrolling dungeon.

I also want to reduce the complexity of the maze because I suspect anyone playing this game would weary of dungeon crawling before they were halfway through it.
