Temple of Rogue
==========

Attempting to make a roguelike with some features inspired by my previous game Temple of ROM.

Work in progress.  Not anywhere near playable yet.

**Update**

Now that I can generate a huge maze, probably the biggest possible, the draw time is unacceptable, of course.  I can do page flipping (or whatever that technique is called these days) but also I probably want to reduce the complexity of the maze.

And I'm still not yet drawing the player and scrolling him around; that'll keep me busy for a few days.

Once I finish that, I've got to figure out what kind of game I want to make out of this; so far it's just figuring out the mechanics of generating/drawing a scrolling dungeon.

I also want to reduce the complexity of the maze because I suspect anyone playing this game would weary of dungeon crawling before they were halfway through it.

There's also a technique I used in Temple of ROM for optimizing rendering time by windowing through the maze data based on the current viewport; I've got to figure out exactly how I did that.
